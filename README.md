### By Otoniel Mercado
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Outline

This project entails a budget management and expense tracking tool crafted using React and Redux. It empowers users to allocate their funds across nine distinct categories, including Housing, Food, Transportation, Utilities, Clothing, Healthcare, Personal, Education, and Entertainment. Additionally, users can log multiple transactions within each category, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure details alongside remaining funds.
